## Conference Management Systems ##

The purpose of the Conference Management System application is to support the automatic management of information related to scientific conferences. Its aim is to provide a means to simplify the way in which researchers publish, get feedback on and expose their work in a certain field to the public. In addition to that, it allows for much easier planning and management of scientific conferences and sessions, from organization to attendance. The organization of such an event can be split into three distinct phases, namely the preliminary phase, phase one, phase two and phase three. The preliminary phase includes the registration of the individuals that make up the Program Committee, in case of a new conference, or the log-in of the Steering Committee, in the situation that the given conference is a recurring one. Phase one represents the part of the life-cycle of the conference in which authors get to submit their papers, as candidates for the conference. During the second phase, Program Committee members are required to review each submitted paper, in order to determine whether a given proposal will be presented during the conference sessions. The third and last phase concerns the activities taking place during the actual conference, the most important of them being the presentation of the papers.
